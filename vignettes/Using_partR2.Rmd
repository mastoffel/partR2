The goal of `partR2` is to partition the variance explained in generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) into variation unique to and shared among predictors. This can be done using semi-partial (or 'part') $R^2$. But the package also does a few other things. Here is a quick summary of what you can learn about your mixed model with `partR2`:

* Marginal and conditional $R^2$ (*sensu* Nakagawa & Schielzeth, 2013)
* Part $R^2$ unique to each predictor and for each combination of predictors (fixed effects)
* Structure coefficients (SC), i.e. the correlation between each predictor and the predicted response (the contribution of a predictor to the model when ignoring all other predictors) (see Yeatts et al., 2017)
* Inclusive $R^2$, which we define as explained variance of a predictor in the predicted response irrespective
of covariances with other predictors. It is calculated as $SC^2 * R^2$, the squared structure coefficient
times the $R^2$ of the full model.
* Standardized model estimates called beta weights. These are calculated with
$\beta * (sd(x)/sd(y))$, where $\beta$ is the regression slope, $x$ is the covariate and $y$ is the response. 
* Confidence intervals for all relevant estimators through parametric bootstrapping

The workhorse of the package is a single function, `partR2()`. It takes a fitted model from `lme4` (Bates et al. 2015), with either a Gaussian, Poisson or binomial family. The function returns a `partR2` object. The package has `print`, `summary` and `forestplot` functions for `partR2` objects, and a useful helper function `mergeR2` for models with interactions which we introduce below.

Before we go through some examples, we load the `biomass` dataset. This is a simulated dataset that aims to mimic a study on biomass production in grasslands. In a nutshell, virtual invertebrates were sampled once every year over 10 successive years (*Year*) from 20 different virtual populations (*Population*). *Temperature* and *Precipitation* were measured and overall species diversity (*SpeciesDiversity*) and *Biomass* were recorded for each *Population* in each *Year*.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
# remotes::install_github("mastoffel/partR2)
library(partR2)
library(lme4)
data("biomass")
head(biomass)
```

Before we proceed, we standardise some variables to bring them to the same scale and make their slope estimates comparable (see Schielzeth 2010 for a discussion).
```{r}
biomass[] <- lapply(biomass, function(x) if (is.double(x)) scale(x) else x)
```

## Partitioning R^2^ in a Gaussian mixed model

First of all, we check whether the *Biomass* in our dataset follows a Gaussian distribution.
```{r}
hist(biomass$Biomass, main = "Biomass")
```

That looks alright. Next, we fit a linear mixed model in `lme4`. We assume, that the *Biomass* depends on effects of the *Year*, *Temperature*, *Precipitation* and *SpeciesDiversity*. We also fit a random effect to account for differences among populations.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
mod1 <- lmer(Biomass ~ Year + Temperature + Precipitation + 
             SpeciesDiversity + (1|Population), 
             data = biomass)
```

Now we would usually do the standard model checks and evaluations to ensure that the model works well. For the sake of simplicity (and because we simulated the data from Gaussian distributions), we skip that step here and go straight into the `partR2` part. We first calculate the overall marginal $R^2$ and use parametric bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals. Marginal $R^2$ refers to the variance explained by fixed effect predictors relative to the total variance in the response. Alternatively, we can estimate conditional $R^2$ (by setting `R2_type ="conditional"`), which is the variance explained by fixed effects and random effects together relative to the total variance in the response.

Note that we are supplying the fitted `merMod` object (the `lme4` output) and the original dataset (in the `data` argument) used to fit the model.  This is required, because the `merMod` object does not contain all necessary information to perform the `partR2` analysis. There is one important thing to pay attention to: If there are missing observations for some of the predictors/response, `lmer` and `glmer` will remove those rows containing NAs, which will result in a mismatch between the data in the `data` object and the data used fit the model. In order to avoid complications, it is advisable to remove rows with missing data prior to the fitting the model. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
R2_mod1 <- partR2(mod1, R2_type = "marginal", nboot = 10, data = biomass)
R2_mod1
```

The marginal $R^2$ is around 60% and confidence intervals are fairly narrow. *Temperature* and *Precipitation* are highly correlated in the dataset (as they often are in real-life situations) and we want to know how much each of them uniquely explains and what they explain together.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
R2_mod1 <- partR2(mod1, partvars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation"), 
                        R2_type = "marginal", nboot = 10,  data = biomass)
R2_mod1
```

So it seems that *Temperature* and *Precipitation* uniquely only explain around 4% and 9% in the variation in *Biomass*, respectively. Together however, they explain around 39% of the variation. This situation is typical for correlated predictors, since part $R^2$ is the variance *uniquely* explained by each predictor and a large part of the variance is explained by both predictors. Part $R^2$ is calculated as the difference in $R^2$ between the full model and a reduced model which does not contain the respective predictor. So if *Temperature* is removed, the explained variances is not greatly reduced, because the variance is still explained by *Precipitation* (as both are highly correlated). This is why the $R^2$ unique to *Temperature* is only 4%.  

Besides part $R^2$s, `partR2` also outputs inclusive $R^2$, standardized model estimates (beta weights), and structure coefficients, which are shown when calling the `summary()` function. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
summary(R2_mod1)
```

Beta weights show that all four predictors seem to have some effect on *Biomass* because none of the confidence intervals overlaps zero, while the effect of *Precipitation* is the largest. Structure coefficients tell us that both *Temperature* and *Precipitation* are quite strongly correlated with the predicted *Biomass* from the model. Structure coefficients effectively give us the contribution of a predictor to the model prediction in the absence of all other predictors (with a maximum magnitude of ±1). SC are correlation coefficients and by squaring them and multiplying by the marginal $R^2$ of the model we get what we call inclusive $R^2$ or short IR^2^ ($IR^2 = SC^2 * R^2$). SC and IR^2^ are large for *Temperature* and *Precipitation* as both are highly correlated to the predicted response, but their semi-partial or part $R^2$s (the variance that they uniquely explain) are small due to their correlation. 

## Limiting the amount of combinations

The number of combinations for part $R^2$ increases exponentially with $2^n-1$ combinations for n predictors. There are two possibilities to decrease the number of sets for which R^2^ is calculated and to reduce the computational burden. Our model `mod1` has four predictors and hence $2^4-1 = 15$ combinations. If we only wanted the part $R^2$ for each predictor but not their combinations, we can specify `max_level`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
R2_short <- partR2(mod1, partvars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation", "Year", "SpeciesDiversity"), 
                   R2_type = "marginal", data = biomass, max_level = 1)
R2_short
```

`max_level` = 2 would give all combinations up to a maximum of two predictors and so on. 

Another option is `partbatch` which takes a list of character vectors. The terms in each character vector are then always fitted or removed together. This is most useful for models with many variables, e.g. when using dummy coding or when predictors are otherwise linked in any meaningful way. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
R2_batch <- partR2(mod1, partvars = c("SpeciesDiversity"), 
                   partbatch = list(batch1 = c("Temperature", "Precipitation")),
                   R2_type = "marginal", data = biomass)
R2_batch
```

For convenience it is also possible to name the elements in the list given to `partbatch`, then the output shows the name of the batch instead of all single list elements.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
R2_batch <- partR2(mod1, partvars = c("SpeciesDiversity"), 
                   partbatch = list(ClimateVars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation")),
                   R2_type = "marginal", data = biomass)
R2_batch
```

## Plotting

We can now plot the results as forestplots, powered by `ggplot2` (Wickham, 2016). We
added a few arguments to easily customize the plot, see `?forestplot`.

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height=2.5}
forestplot(R2_mod1, type = "R2", line_size = 0.5, text_size = 12, point_size = 3)
```

The output of `forestplot` is a `ggplot` object so we can change it using ggplot syntax or assemble multiple plots with packages like `patchwork` (Pedersen, 2019). We can also plot the inclusive $R^2$s, structure coefficients and beta weights.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height=5}
library(patchwork)
p1 <- forestplot(R2_mod1, type = "R2", text_size = 10)
p2 <- forestplot(R2_mod1, type = "IR2", text_size = 10)
p3 <- forestplot(R2_mod1, type = "SC", text_size = 10)
p4 <- forestplot(R2_mod1, type = "BW", text_size = 10)
(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4) + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")
```

However, if you prepare a publication, you probably want the data to plot it yourself or put it in a table. Here is how the results can be retrieved from a `partR2` object:

```{r}
# An overview
str(R2_mod1, max.level = 1)
```

The list shows the key elements of `partR2` that contain (a) the point estimates and confidence intervals and (b) bootstrap replicates. Note that each bootstrap replicate refers to a fit to a simulated data (simulated based on model estimates).

```{r, results=FALSE}
# point estimates and confidence intervals
R2_mod1$R2   # R2s
R2_mod1$SC   # Structure coefficients
R2_mod1$IR2  # inclusive R2s
R2_mod1$BW # Standardised model estimates
R2_mod1$Ests # Model estimates

# bootstrap replicates
R2_mod1$R2_boot
R2_mod1$SC_boot
R2_mod1$IR2_boot
R2_mod1$BW_boot
R2_mod1$Ests_boot
```

## Check warnings from bootstrapping

Parametric bootstrapping works through simulating new response variables and refitting the model. This sometimes causes warnings when the models based on simulated data are fitted. `partR2` captures those warnings (and messages) and saves them. Lets have a look at potential warnings and messages for the first two simulations.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
R2_mod1$boot_warnings[1:2]
R2_mod1$boot_messages[1:2]
```
No warnings or messages in our case. But you might find something in your own analyses, for example convergence or singularity warnings or messages. Just make sure that you had a look, though these are typically not major problems (at least when the initial model fit wasn't problematic).

## Special cases for part $R^2$s

### Part $R^2$s for interactions
There are two ways in which interaction terms can be included in the `formula` argument. The familiar `*` statement allows fitting terms with their main effects and their interactions, while the `:` statement fits only the interactions. This is important to know, because we need to use the `:` version to tell `partR2` that we require a part $R^2$ for an interaction.  

It is possible to estimate part $R^2$ for models with interaction terms, but requires some thought. To calculate the part $R^2$ of a predictor, the predictor is removed from the model and the part $R^2$ is calculated as the difference in $R^2$ between the full and the reduced model. When two predictors are also involved in an interaction, we can easily remove the interaction itself. Removing one of the main effects, however, will not necessarily yield an easily interpretable part $R^2$, because main effects and interactions are often correlated. When removing one of the main effects, the interaction will often take over some of the explained variance. Here, we present a few ways on how to deal with interactions. (Note that centering will often reduce the correlations such that main effects and their $R^2$s are interpretable even in the presence of interactions, see Schielzeth 2010.)

#### 1) Only estimate $R^2$ of the interaction, but not the main effects

A prudent version is to assess the interaction term only. We can fit the model with the `*` statement (which actually fits *Temperature* + *Precipitation* + *Temperature*:*Precipitation*) and then request only the variance explained by the interaction. The interaction needs to be specified with the `:` syntax, so that the `partvars` argument gets `Temperature:Precipitation`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
mod2 <- lmer(Biomass ~ Temperature * Precipitation + (1|Population), 
             data = biomass)
R2_mod2a <- partR2(mod2, partvars = c("Temperature:Precipitation"), 
                   data = biomass)
R2_mod2a
```

Here, the part $R^2$ of the interaction is relatively small. When a main effect is also involved in an interaction, the variance explained by the main effect is usually also explained by the interaction, such that the unique variance explained by either the interaction or the main effect is often small.

Interpreting only the variance explained by the interactions might not be satisfactory. Next, we'll go through three possibilities to deal with interactions when you are interested in part $R^2$ of the main effects and the interaction.

#### 2) Estimate main effects despite interactions

One option is to estimate the variance explained by main effects irrespective of whether there are interactions. We can do this by specifying main effects (and interactions) in the `partvars` argument. As a consequence, `partR2` will iteratively remove each of those predictors and calculate the difference in $R^2$ between the full model and each reduced model, respectively, to calculate part $R^2$s for each predictor and combination of predictors.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
R2_mod2b <- partR2(mod2, partvars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation", "Precipitation:Temperature"),
                   data = biomass, max_level = 1)
R2_mod2b
```

Using a Venn diagram, we can show what we actually just estimated. Here, Y is the total variance of the response, Y~RE~ is the variance explained by random effects, Y~R~ is the residual variance. The other fields are the variance explained by the main effects, the interaction and what's shared between them. 

Basically, we estimated part $R^2$ for the main effects and the interaction alone, but the
variance shared by both is neither attributed to the main effect nor the interaction. We are
attributing the variance Y~x1~ (horizontal stripes) to the first main effect (say *Temperature*) and Y~x2~ (vertical stripes) to the second main effect (*Precipitation*). Finally, Y~int~ (horizontal and vertical stripes) is attributed to the the interaction.

![](venn1.jpeg){ width=80% }

This might not be what we are most interested in. Here's a second approach.

#### 3) Pooling main effect and interaction variance

One way to think about variance explained by main effects and their interactions is to pool the variance explained by a main effect with the variance explained by interactions that the term is involved in. Here, *Temperature* might be important either as a main effect or in interaction with *Precipitation* and we might want to estimate the total effect of *Temperature*. The same might be true for *Temperature*. This can be done using the `partbatch` argument, which can be used to calculate part $R^2$ for batches of predictors.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
R2_mod2c <- partR2(mod2, partbatch = list(c("Temperature", "Temperature:Precipitation"), 
                                          c("Precipitation", "Temperature:Precipitation")),
                        data = biomass)
R2_mod2c
```

We are getting part $R^2$'s for the combined effects of each main effect and its interaction. These can again be visualized using a Venn diagram:

![](venn2.jpeg){ width=80% }

Here, X1 is the (combined) part $R^2$ for *Temperature* and *Temperature*:*Precipitation*, and X2 is the (combined) part R^2^ for *Precipitation* and *Temperature*:*Precipitation*. 

#### 4) Estimating main effects and interactions in separate models and combine (Main effect priority)

The last option is then one that we think is usually preferable. The option involves prioritization of main effects by assigning the proportion of variance that is explained by a main effect together with the variance jointly explained with its interaction to the main effect. This implies that only the part $R^2$ for an interaction is calculated from a first model fit (`mod3a` and `R2_mod3a` below). Subsequently, in a second model fit, the variance explained by the main effects is estimated when their interaction is excluded from the model (`mod4b` and `R2_mod4b` below).  We have implemented a helper function `mergeR2` that allows to merge the two `partR2` runs.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

mod3a <- lmer(Biomass ~ Temperature * Precipitation + (1|Population), data = biomass)
R2_mod3a <- partR2(mod3a, partvars = c("Temperature:Precipitation"), data = biomass)

mod3b <- lmer(Biomass ~ Temperature + Precipitation + (1|Population), data = biomass)
R2_mod3b <- partR2(mod3a, partvars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation"), data = biomass,
                   max_level = 1)

R2_merged <- mergeR2(R2_mod3a, R2_mod3b)
R2_merged

```

![](venn3.jpeg){ width=80% }

Here, the part $R^2$ of *Temperature* could be X1 (horizontal stripes), the part $R^2$ of *Precipitation* could be X2 (vertical stripes) and the *Temperature*:*Precipitation* is X1:X2 or Y~int~ in the Venn diagram. Here, all part $R^2$s are rather low because *Precipitation* and *Temperature* are correlated.

#### Note on interactions with factorial predictors

A special case are interactions involving factorial predictors. For illustration, we fit *Year* as a factor in interaction with *Temperature* while limiting the data to the first three years.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
biomassSub <- subset(biomass, Year < 1994)
biomassSub$YearFact <- factor(biomassSub$Year)
modSub1 <- lmer(Biomass ~ Temperature * YearFact + (1|Population), 
             data = biomassSub)
R2_modSub1 <- partR2(modSub1, partvars = c("Temperature", "YearFact", "YearFact:Temperature"), data = biomassSub)
R2_modSub1
```

The column `ndf` shows that the full model and the model without intercept have the same numbers of fitted parameters. For such a model with one covariate, a three-level factor and their interaction, the model has estimates six parameters in the fixed part: one intercept, one for the main effect of the covariate, two contrasts for the main-effect of the three-level factor and two contrasts for the interaction. Now, if the covariate is removed from the model, the contrasts will be reparameterized, such that there are still six parameters estimated in the fixed part: one intercept, two contrast for the main-effect of the three-level factor, and three for the interactions.

One way to prevent this reparametrization of the design matrices is the use of dummy coded variables. 
```{r, warning=FALSE}
biomassSub$y1991 <- as.numeric(biomassSub$Year==1991)
biomassSub$y1992 <- as.numeric(biomassSub$Year==1992)
biomassSub$y1993 <- as.numeric(biomassSub$Year==1993)
```

Now we can keep the three dummy-coded (and centered) *Year* variables together in a named `partbatch` argument.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
modSub2 <- lmer(Biomass ~ Temperature * (y1992 + y1993) + (1|Population), 
             data = biomassSub)
R2_modSub2 <- partR2(modSub2, partvars = c("Temperature"), 
             partbatch = list(Year = c("y1992", "y1993"), 
             'Year:Temperature' = c("y1992:Temperature", "y1993:Temperature")), 
             data = biomassSub)
R2_modSub2
```

Now the model removing *Temperature* has just five parameters fitted. Note that year 1991 is in this case used as a reference level.

### Part $R^2$s for models with transformations in the formula

We generally advice to do all variable transformation before fitting the model. However, if for some reason this is not possible, it is important to specify the variable in the `partvars` argument exactly (!) how it was done in the model. Here is an example where we fit and additional term for the *Precipitation^2^* in the formula. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
mod3 <- lmer(Biomass ~ Temperature + Precipitation + I(Precipitation^2) + (1|Population), 
             data = biomass)
```

Now we can specify the exact same term in the `partvars` argument.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
R2_mod3 <- partR2(mod3, partvars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation", "I(Precipitation^2)"), 
                  data = biomass)
R2_mod3
```

## Running `partR2` in parallel

Parametric bootstrapping is an inherently slow process, because it involves repeated fitting of mixed effects models. Furthermore, the computation time increases exponentially with the number of terms requested, all being tested in isolation and in combination. It is therefore advisable to run preliminary analysis first with low numbers of bootstraps, just to see that things work and make sense in principle. The final analysis should be done with a large number of bootstraps (at least 100, better 1000). This can take time.

A simple way to save runtime is to distribute the bootstrap iterations across multiple cores. `partR2` parallelizes with the `future` (Bengtsson, 2019) and `furrr` (Vaughan & Dancho, 2018) packages. This makes it flexible for the user on how exactly to parallelize and should work on whatever OS you are running your analyses, be it Mac, Windows or Linux. 

We will illustrate this with the `mod2` fitted above. First we specify how we want to parallelize using `future`'s `plan()` function. Check out `?future::plan` for more information on this. Generally, if you are running your analyses in RStudio, they recommend using `plan(multisession)`. After specifying the plan, you only need to supply a `parallel = TRUE` argument to `partR2` and everything will run in parallel. If you didn't specify a plan, `partR2` will just run sequentially.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(future)
# how many cores do I have?
parallel::detectCores()
# specify plan
plan(multisession, workers = 3)
R2_mod2 <- partR2(mod2, partvars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation"), 
                        nboot = 10, parallel = TRUE, data = biomass)
```

## Partitioning $R^2$ in Poisson and binomial models

Partitioning the $R^2$ in Poisson and binomial models works in exactly the same way and with the same function.  We simulated a (Poisson distributed) response variable *Extinction* for the biomass dataset.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
hist(biomass$Extinction)
```

Let's first fit a Poisson model using `glmer`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
mod4 <- glmer(Extinction ~ Year +  Temperature * Precipitation + SpeciesDiversity + (1|Population), 
            data=biomass, family="poisson")
```

Then we can use `partR2` as before. 

```{r, warning = FALSE}
R2_mod4 <- partR2(mod4, partvars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation"), 
                   R2_type = "marginal", nboot = NULL, CI = 0.95, data=biomass)
print(R2_mod4, round_to = 3) # rounding decimals in print and summary
```
One thing to have in mind when using GLMMs are observation-level random effects (OLRE, i.e. Harrison 2014). `partR2` fits them internally to quantify overdispersion but will recognise an OLRE when it is already in the model. We do not fit an OLRE for binomial models with binary responses because in this case there is no overdispersion. 

Finally, a simple example for a binomial model with a proportion response.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mod5 <- glmer(cbind(Recovered, NotRecovered) ~ Year +  
              Temperature * Precipitation + SpeciesDiversity + (1|Population), 
              data=biomass, family="binomial")
```

And we just parse it to `partR2()` again. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
R2_mod5 <- partR2(mod5, partvars = c("Temperature", "Precipitation"), 
                   R2_type = "marginal", nboot = NULL, CI = 0.95, data=biomass)
summary(R2_mod5, round_to=3)
```

As you might have noticed, both Poisson and binomials models give low $R^2$ values -- even though they have been generated with similar parameter settings as the Gaussian data. This situation is common and originates from the inherent rounding when traits are expressed as discrete or binary numbers. Fixed and random effects explain variation only at the latent scale, but inherent distribution-specific variance contribute to the residual variances. This leads to large residual variance and relatively lower variance components.

## Under the hood
The `partR2` function takes the fitted model and calculates the variances in the linear predictor. R^2^ is calculated relative to the total variance in the response, where the total variance is calculated as the sum of random effect, residual and fixed effect components. For GLMM this includes the distribution-specific variance (Nakagawa and Schielzeth 2010). Note also that for GLMM with Poisson or proportion data, the function searches for an observation-level random effect (OLRE, a random effect with as many levels as the response) to account for overdispersion. If no such predictor is found, an OLRE is added to the model and a message is printed to screen. This addition is usually advisable (though it does not control for all causes of overdispersion, Harrison 2014). It is possible to suppress fitting of on OLRE by setting `olre = FALSE`. All beta weights reported by `partR2` are based on the model estimates extracted by the `broom.mixed` package.  
In a next step, `partR2` uses the list of predictors provided in partvars to fit a series of models in which each matching predictor is removed from the model individually and in combination with other matching predictors. For n predictors in partvars this results in 2^n-1 reduced model fits and thus an exponential increase of computation time. For each reduced model, the variance explained by fixed effects is estimated and the reduction relative to the full model is attributed to the missing predictor or set of predictors. Structure coefficients are estimated as the correlation between predictors in partvars and the linear predictor of the full model (fixed part only, using `lme4::predict.merMod(…, re.form=NA)`). Note that the calculation of structure coefficients as well as fitting reduced models requires that the data provided in the `data` argument matches exactly the data used in the merMod fit.
The procedures described so far yield point estimates for the parameters for interest. Sampling variance is quantified by parametric bootstrapping. Parametric bootstrapping is based on the idea that if the full model represents an estimate of the underlying biological processes and new data are generated using exactly the same process and the same sampling design, then any fluctuation in estimates can be attributed to sampling variation alone (Faraway 2014). We therefore generate new data from the full model under the same sampling design using the `lme4::simulate.merMod` function (Bates et al. 2015). The same sampling design means that the fixed effects model matrix is assumed to be fixed, that the number of random effect levels is the same and that the distribution of random effect levels over covariates is fixed. 
For each bootstrap dataset we reiterate the full process of fitting a full model, estimating the variance explained by fixed effects, estimate model parameters, structure coefficients, inclusive R^2^, followed by fitting of reduced models and monitoring the change in variance explained by fixed effects. All estimates for each bootstrap iteration and are stored in the `R2_boot`, `SC_boot`, `IR2_boot`, `BW_boot` and `Ests_boot` elements of the `partR2` object. The set of bootstraps is used to estimate confidence intervals (the 2.5% and 97.5% quantile for 95% CI). Note that in particular the quantiles will be estimated accurately only with a large number of bootstraps. Computation time increases linearly with the number of bootstrap iterations. 
We have implemented the analysis for Gaussian, binomial and Poisson GLMMs, because these seem to be most widely used in the study of ecology and evolution. For non-Gaussian GLMMs, part R^2^ are calculated on the link scale. Part R2 on the data-scale estimates are considered problematic and we think that link-scale estimates are usually what is more informative. Additions of other GLMM families are possible in the future (see Nakagawa et al. 2017). 

## `rptR` and `partR2`: ratios of variance components

The `rptR` (Stoffel et al., 2017) package and the `partR2` package go hand in hand. The intra-class coefficient or repeatability calculated in `rptR` is the proportion of variance explained by random effects while the `partR2` package estimates the proportion of variance explained by fixed effects (or fixed plus random effects when `R2_type = "conditional"`). Both the repeatability R and the coefficient of determination $R^2$ are therefore ratios of variance components. However, we now changed the design of the `partR2` package compared to `rptR`. The `partR2` user now fits the model first in `lme4` so that any modeling problem can be recognized straight away. We think this is generally preferable as it separates the modeling part from the rest of the calculations and allows the user to focus on specifying an appropriate model first.
